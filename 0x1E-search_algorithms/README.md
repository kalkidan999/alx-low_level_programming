# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm (typically involving a multitude of other, more specific algorithms [1]) which solves a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.
Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching into 3 types of algorithms: linear, binary, and hashing. Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.[4] Binary, or half interval searches, repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.[5] Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys.[6] Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.[7]

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
